Title: {title}
Abstract: {abstract}

We want to evalute this abstract in terms of alignment with "The Bitter Lesson". The main idea of Rich Sutton's "The Bitter Lesson" is that the most effective AI approaches in the long run are those that leverage computation and general-purpose methods like search and learning, rather than human-designed systems that try to build in human knowledge. Evaluate the alignment of the abstract with the following principles, assigning a score from 0 to 10 for each.
